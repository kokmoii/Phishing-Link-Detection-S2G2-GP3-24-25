## About The Project

Phishing scams are a growing threat in the digital age, exploiting users by mimicking legitimate websites to steal sensitive information. This project introduces a web application designed to detect phishing URLs efficiently and accurately using machine learning techniques.

### Key Features:
- Real-time URL verification
- User-friendly interface
- High detection accuracy using Random Forest algorithm

### File :
- Phishing_sample_datanew.csv (Dataset for Training and Testing Model)
- MLprojectDataProcessing.ipynb ( Used for cleaning and sort dataset)
- app.py (Tools Deployment)
- pipeline_project.ipynb (Pipeline between the dataset and tuning Model)
- tuned_model.pkl ( A Tuned model imported by using pickle from pipeline_project.ipynb)
